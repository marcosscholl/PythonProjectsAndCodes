TempSensor
----------

This project includes a very simple Arduino sketch
which reads the environment temperature using an LM35 sensor,
smooths it and sends it over the XBee shield.

Using monitor.py, a client computer with the other XBee connected
can plot the temperature data transmitted by the Router AT
wirelessly.

You need:
 - PyQt
 - PyQwt
 - PySerial

Python modules for this to work correctly.

Note that the serial port is hardcoded in SerialMonitor.py, change
it to fit your needs.

The Plotter application is a simplified/modified version of Eli Bendersky's
plotter:
